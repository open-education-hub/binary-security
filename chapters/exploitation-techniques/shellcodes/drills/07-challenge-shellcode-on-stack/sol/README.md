### Building and running

**Running challenge**
Make sure you are in the `sol` directory and run the following command:

```bash
./run.sh
```
This will build the `challenge07` docker and run it. Afterwards, the `vuln`
executable will be copied to the `sol` directory and the `exploit.py` script
will be executed.
Cleanup will be done automatically after the script is finished.
