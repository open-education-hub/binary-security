### Building and running

**Using the provided Makefile**

Make sure you are in the `sol` directory and run the following commands:

```console
# Build the Docker image
make build

# Run the container and copy the binary
make run

# Execute the exploit
make exploit

# Clean up when finished
make clean
```

The Makefile automates the process of building the Docker image, running the
container, copying the binary and executing the exploit script.
The `make clean` command will remove all resources when you're done.
