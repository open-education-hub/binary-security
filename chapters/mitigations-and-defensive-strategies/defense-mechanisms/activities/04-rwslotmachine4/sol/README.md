# Building and Running

The included Makefile automates building and running the Docker container.

- Build the Docker image:

    ```bash
    make build
    ```

- Run the container:

    ```bash
    make run
    ```

- Stop the running container:

    ```bash
    make stop
    ```

- Clean up container state:

    ```bash
    make clean
    ```
